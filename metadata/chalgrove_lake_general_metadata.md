# General Metadata for Chalgrove Lake YSI Data 

## Files

Specific metadata for each deployment can be found as text files with the file format of:

    chalgrove_lake_DDMonthYYYY_metadata.txt
    
Where DDMonthYYY is the date that the deployment ended.

## Description

These data are from a YSI EXO2 multiparameter sonde deployed at approximatly 0.7 m in Chalgrove Lake (37.242983 N, -78.464116 W) in approximately 4 m of water.

## Sonde Specifics

  The specific sensors and SNs deployed are on the metadata specific to each deployment but generally the sonde has:
  
  * Temperature
  * Conductivity
  * pH
  * ODO
  * Total Algae
  
## Measurement Parameters, units, and Variable Names

  * date.time = the combined date and time of the measurement (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
  * date = the sampling date reported by the YSI (M/D/YYYY)
  * time = the sampling time reported by the YSI (HH:MM:SS)
  * fract_sec = the smapling fractions of a second reported by the YSI
  * site_name = the site name on the YSI deployment (left blank)
  * cond = the conductivity (uS/cm)
  * nLF_cond = the nLF conductivity (uS/cm)
  * perc_ODO = the percent oxygen saturation
  * perc_local_ODO = the percent local oxygen saturation
  * ODO_conc = the dissolved oxygen concentration (mg/L)
  * sal = the salinity (psu)
  * sp_cond = the specific conductivity (uS/cm)
  * TDS = the total dissolved solids (mg/L)
  * pH = the pH
  * pH mV = the millivolts of the pH sensor
  * temp = the temperature (dC)
  * battery = the battery voltage
  * cable_pwr = the cable power
