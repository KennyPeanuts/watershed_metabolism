# General Metadata for Via Sacra Pond YSI Data

## Files

Specific metadata for each deployment can be found as text files with the file format of:

    via_sacra_pond_YYYY-MM-DD_metadata.txt
    
Where YYYY-MM-DD is the date that the deployment ended.

## Description

These data are from a YSI EXO3 multiparameter sonde deployed at approximatly 0.4 m in Via Sacra Pond (37.223340 N, -78.473026 W) in approximately 1 m of water.

## Sonde Specifics

  The specific sensors and SNs deployed are on the metadata specific to each deployment but generally the sonde has:
  
  * Temperature
  * Conductivity
  * ODO
  * Total Algae
  * Turbidity
  * fDOM
  
## Measurement Parameters, units, and Variable Names

  * date.time = the combined date and time of the measurement (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
  * date = the sampling date reported by the YSI (M/D/YYYY)
  * time = the sampling time reported by the YSI (HH:MM:SS)
  * fract_sec = the sampling fractions of a second reported by the YSI
  * site_name = the site name on the YSI deployment (left blank)
  * chl_RFU = the chlorophyll concentration (RFU)
  * chl_conc = the chlorophyll concentration (ug/L)
  * cond = the conductivity (uS/cm)
  * nLF_cond = the nLF conductivity (uS/cm)
  * perc_ODO = the percent oxygen saturation
  * perc_local_ODO = the percent local oxygen saturation
  * ODO_conc = the dissolved oxygen concentration (mg/L)
  * sal = the salinity (psu)
  * sp_cond = the specific conductivity (uS/cm)
  * BGA_PC_RFU = the Blue-green algae Phycocyanin concentration (RFU)
  * BGA_PC_conc = the Blue-green algae Phycocyanin concentration (ug/L)
  * TDS = the total dissolved solids (mg/L)
  * temp = the temperature (dC)
  * turb_FNU = the turbidity (FNU)
  * TSS = total suspended solids
  * battery = the battery voltage
  * cable_pwr = the cable power
