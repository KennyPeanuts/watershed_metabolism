## Purpose

These calculations are to determine the amount of stock nutrient solution that we need to add to the bottles in the nutrient limitation experiments in Campus Pond. 



Given this, I am setting the target concentrations to these levels.


## Calculations

### General Formula

    (Vt / Ct) = (Vs / Cs)

* Vt = the volume of the treatment bottle (L)
* Ct = the target concentration of the treatment bottle (g/L)
* Vs = the volume of the stock added to the treatment (L)
* Cs = the concentration of the stock solution (g/L)

To calculate the concentration of stock needed this gets rearranged to:

    Cs = (CtVt)/Vt

### DIN

To get a target concentration of 300 ug/L, which equals 300 ug/L * 1 g / 1000000 ug = 0.0003 g/L DIN we would need:

    Cs = (0.0003 * 1) / 0.001 = 0.3 g/L DIN

The molecular weight of NH4NO3 = 80.052 g/mol

The molecular weight of N = 14 g/mol

Since NH4NO3 has 2 N, the N weighs 28 g/mol

Thus the N is `35%` of the mass of the NH4NO3

    28 / 80.052 = 0.35 

So to get 0.3 g/L, we need to dissolve `0.857 g` NH4NO3 into 1 L of di water

    0.35x = 0.3 --> x = 0.3/0.35 = 0.857

### Phosphorus

To get a target concentration of 30 ug/L, which equals 30 ug/L * 1 g / 1000000 ug = 0.00003 g/L P we would need:

    Cs = (0.00003 * 1) / 0.001 = 0.03 g/L P

The molecular weight of KH2PO4 = 120.087

The P weighs 30.97 g/mol

Thus the P is `26%` of the mass of the PO4

    30.97 / 120.087

So to get 0.03 g/L P we would need to dissolve `0.115 g` PO4 into 1 L of DI water.

    0.26x = 0.03 --> x = 0.03/0.26 = 0.115
