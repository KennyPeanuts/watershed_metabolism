        Intrinsic (lability) and extrinsic (env. factors) drivers of DOC turnover are integrated by water-residence-time, and thus will change as you move downstream in a watershed (i.e., increasing WRT). As a result, the greatest DOC turnover is hypothesized to be at intermediate WRT (i.e., lakes, big rivers, estuaries).
