<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This document contains the details of the experimental design for the nutrient limitation experiment in Campus Pond on the campus of Longwood University begun during the Fall semester of 2021.
</p>

<h3>Site Description</h3>
<p>
Campus pond is an in&ndash;line, constructed stormwater retention basin on Gross Creek located on the Longwood University Campus. The maximum depth varies a lot due to stream inputs but the height of the concrete barrier is approximately 0.7 m from the sediments.
</p>

<h3>Experimental Details</h3>
<h4>Response variables</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Algal biomass measured as Chlorophyll a concentration in the water</li>
  <li>Algal NPP measured as the change in algal biomass over a 48 h period</li>
</ol>

<h4>Treatments and Treatment Levels</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Nutrient Availability &mdash; nutrient availability will be modified by adding DIN or DIP to the bottles prior to incubation.
    <ul>
      <li>Control &mdash; no added nutrients</li>
      <li>+N &mdash; increase by 8 mg/L DIN</li>
      <li>+P &mdash; increase by 0.5 mg/L DIP</li>
      <li>+N+P &mdash; increase by 8 mg/L DIN and 0.5 mg/L DIP</li>
   </ul>
  <li>Season &mdash; the nutrient bioassay will be run twice a month for the duration of the experiment.</li>
  <li>Hydrology &mdash; LEO data on water depth will be used to determine the water level in the pond and this will be compared to the results of the nutrient bioassay.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Response Variable</h4>
<p>
The response will be the change in algal biomass, measured as the change in concentration of Chl a in the water during the incubation. The change in concentration of Chl a will be determined as: <em>Chl<sub>initial</sub> - Chl<sub>final</sub></em>.
</p>
<p>
Another response will be the pond algal biomass, determined from <em>Chl<sub>initial</sub></em>.
</p>

<h4>Experimental Units and Replication</h4>
<p>
The experimental unit will be a 300 ml BOD bottle.
</p>
<p>
With 4 replicates of each treatment level, we will need to incubate 16 BOD bottles.
</p>
<p>
The initial chlorophyll concentration will be determined without incubation so those samples will not need a BOD bottle.
</p> 

<h3>Experimental Protocol</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Collect 6 L of pond water from the surface of the pond.</li>
  <li>Filter the water through 153 &mu;m mesh to remove zooplankton and coarse debris.</li>
  <li>Filter 4 replicate <em>Chl<sub>initial</sub></em> samples onto 25 mm GFF filters and place into foil&ndash;wrapped falcon tubes and store at -20<sup>o</sup> C. (NOTE: Filter enough volume to reasonably clog the filter and record the volume filtered).</li>
  <li>Fill 4 replicate 300 ml BOD bottles for each treatment level (16 total bottles) with 250 ml of filtered pond water.</li>
  <li>Add 1 ml of the appropriate treatment addition (i.e., di&ndash;water, DIN stock, or DIP stock) to each BOD bottle.</li>
  <li>Fill the bottle with 50 ml of pond water. (NOTE, this will overfill the bottles by 1 ml. This is to insure that there will be no air in the bottle when the stopper is added.).</li>
  <li>Randomly attach a full set of treatment levels to a block on the floatation frame.</li>
  <li>Incubate the bottles in the lake for 48 h.</li>
  <li>Filter the contents of each bottle onto a 25 mm GFF filter and place into a foil&ndash;wrapped falcon tube.</li>
  <li>Add 10 ml of 90% acetone to each falcon tube and incubate at 20<sup>o</sup> C for 24 h.</li>
</ol>
