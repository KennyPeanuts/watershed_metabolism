## Description

This document contains the details of the experimental design for the nutrient limitation experiment in Campus Pond on the campus of Longwood University begun during the Fall semester of 2021.


## Site Description

Campus pond is an in&ndash;line, constructed stormwater retention basin on Gross Creek located on the Longwood University Campus. The maximum depth varies a lot due to stream inputs but the height of the concrete barrier is approximately 0.7 m from the sediments.

## Experimental Details
### Response variables

  1. Algal biomass measured as Chlorophyll a concentration in the water
    * determined from Chl_initial_
    
  2. Algal NPP measured as the change in algal biomass over a 48 h period
    * Measured as the change in concentration of Chl a in the water during the incubation. The change in concentration of Chl a will be determined as: Chl_initial_ - Chl_final_


### Treatments and Treatment Levels

  1. Nutrient Availability - nutrient availability will be modified by adding DIN or DIP to the bottles prior to incubation.
    a. Control -  no added nutrients
    b. +N -  increase by 8 mg/L DIN
    c. +P -  increase by 0.5 mg/L DIP
    d. +N+P -  increase by 8 mg/L DIN and 0.5 mg/L DIP

  2. Season - the nutrient bioassay will be run twice a month for the duration of the experiment.
  3. Hydrology - LEO data on water depth will be used to determine the water level in the pond and this will be compared to the results of the nutrient bioassay.


### Experimental Units and Replication

* The experimental unit will be a 300 ml BOD bottle.

<p>
With 4 replicates of each treatment level, we will need to incubate 16 BOD bottles.
</p>
<p>
The initial chlorophyll concentration will be determined without incubation so those samples will not need a BOD bottle.

<h3>Experimental Protocol</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Collect 6 L of pond water from the surface of the pond.</li>
  <li>Filter the water through 153 &mu;m mesh to remove zooplankton and coarse debris.</li>
  <li>Filter 4 replicate <em>Chl<sub>initial</sub></em> samples onto 25 mm GFF filters and place into foil&ndash;wrapped falcon tubes and store at -20<sup>o</sup> C. (NOTE: Filter enough volume to reasonably clog the filter and record the volume filtered).</li>
  <li>Fill 4 replicate 300 ml BOD bottles for each treatment level (16 total bottles) with 250 ml of filtered pond water.</li>
  <li>Add 1 ml of the appropriate treatment addition (i.e., di&ndash;water, DIN stock, or DIP stock) to each BOD bottle.</li>
  <li>Fill the bottle with 50 ml of pond water. (NOTE, this will overfill the bottles by 1 ml. This is to insure that there will be no air in the bottle when the stopper is added.).</li>
  <li>Randomly attach a full set of treatment levels to a block on the floatation frame.</li>
  <li>Incubate the bottles in the lake for 48 h.</li>
  <li>Filter the contents of each bottle onto a 25 mm GFF filter and place into a foil&ndash;wrapped falcon tube.</li>
  <li>Add 10 ml of 90% acetone to each falcon tube and incubate at 20<sup>o</sup> C for 24 h.</li>
