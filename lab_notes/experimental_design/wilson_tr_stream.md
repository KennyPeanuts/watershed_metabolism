## Design Notes

The purpose of this design is to measure stream metabolism as part of the P-func project

The design of the site is based on Hall, R. O. and E. R. Hotchkiss. 2017. "Stream Metabolism" in Methods in Stream Ecology Volume 2: Ecosystem Function. eds. G. A. Lamberti and R. Hauer. Academic Press.

At the site we will need a measure of:

1. mean water depth - to get this we need 
  * discharge (Q), 
  * mean velocity (v), and 
  * stream width (w)

2. light level

3. dissolved oxygen concentration

## Equipment for each Parameter

1. mean water depth

To get this we need to use the z = Q / (w * v) relationship.

To get Q:

  1. Develop a Q ~ z curve over a range of discharge conditions
  2. The Q ~ z curve will also generate a w ~ z and v ~ z curves
  3. The CTD sensor will log z so the curves can be used to estimate Q, w, and v over the logging interval.
